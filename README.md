# OpenPath The Perfect API Template

## Abstract

I have no idea what I am doing at the beginning of this project, but my goal is to create the perfect c# .net core API. I will build this project from the ground up and document each step of the build; however, since this is always a work in progress, where you find I could have done things better, please contribute, don't troll!

Hopefully the end result through my research and your suggestions and Pull Requests, we can build the perfect API together!

## Summary

This project is an attempt to create the perfect API Template for C#. First note, I don't know what that template should look like; however, I have an idea! My current idea is:

- SUPPORT REST: Although the latest, coolest API out their is Graph QL, the API should still support REST.
  - Most programmers are familiar with this interface and we want to make sure our API is accessible by the majority.
- SUPPORT GRAPH QL: but to be current it should also support Graph QL.
- EASY DOCUMENTATION: 
- STANDARDIZATION:
- EASY VERSIONING:
- BRANCHING:
- INTERNATIONAL:
- ROBUST LOGGING:
- TESTIABLE UNITS:
- DECUPLED:
- REUSABLE:
- AUTENTICATION:
- SECURED:

## Build Process

### Part I - RESTful API with basic functions

Build a basic API using the repository pattern and entity framework code first. Create API's that have a reusable underlying pattern that are easy to reused and add to with basic filtering.

### Part II - Documentation

Add self documentation features based on XML and MD Mark Down, plus giving swagger a pretty UI.

### Part III - Standardization 

Refactor existing code to have standard REST responses using the envelope pattern and standard RESTful response.
